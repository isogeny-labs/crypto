# N83 mixed-orbit relation yield and total-runtime selection

- **Status:** `investigating`
- **Kind:** empirical bottleneck and implementation gap
- **Affected work:** [N83 factor-base sweep](../research/koblitz_n83_factor_base_sweep_20261008/), [external XOR handoff](../research/koblitz_n83_factor_base_sweep_20261008/verification/external-xor-20261025/PROTOCOL.md)
- **Next action owner:** N83 factor-base research task
- **Last updated:** 2026-10-25

## Problem

The primary Koblitz GF(2^83) factor-base sweep cannot yet select a base by
fully charged index-calculus runtime because retained explicit-orbit bases
have not produced a measured natural relation yield, closure/rank, linear
algebra, target descent, and same-target rho comparison under one frozen
end-to-end protocol. The current 5+1 and 4+2 mixed-orbit searches expose
bounded, first-identity-pattern SAT instances; a capped search leaves the
relation-yield question open.

The affected curve is `icv1-f2m83-tm6151469093347-debefd74`, with the
primary-arm K=600 base and cross-stream Gray/hash residual pools. The
requested selection criterion is minimum total index-calculus runtime,
including setup and online phases, over the finite declared design grid.

## Evidence and uncertainty

- **Observed:** The [independently replayed hosted 5+1 split panel](../research/koblitz_n83_factor_base_sweep_20261008/verification/hosted-split-panel-20261025/attempt-1/replay-receipt.json) reached 20,000 native conflicts and zero models in each Gray/hash arm. Worker walls were 1,470,249 and 1,223,792 ms respectively on that Linux host; both statuses are `UNKNOWN_search_cap`. The prior 4+2 panel is likewise capped. The [local external-XOR receipt](../research/koblitz_n83_factor_base_sweep_20261008/verification/external-xor-20261025/receipt.json) records four first-pattern 5+1/4+2 Gray/hash arms, each ending `INDETERMINATE` at 2,000,001–2,000,002 conflicts with zero models after 119.2–192.5 seconds of L0 process wall. Its [replay](../research/koblitz_n83_factor_base_sweep_20261008/verification/external-xor-20261025/replay.json) rebuilds all four formulas from exact archive bytes and checks the raw-output hashes and counters.
- **Derived or proved:** None of the capped searches proves relation absence or a cost ordering.
- **Suspected explanation:** The native CDCL backend may be a material solver-stage bottleneck; an XOR-aware backend is a discriminating test, not yet an end-to-end improvement claim.
- **Missing capability:** A verified natural partial producer across enough independent source equations, graph closure, useful rank and log solving for the full-width subgroup, followed by target descent and matched one-target rho with full cost accounting.
- **What this evidence does not establish:** A selected best base, relation rate, a complete index-calculus solve, or an end-to-end speedup.

## What would unblock it

- [ ] Independently replay natural partials against the exact S3 base/pool bytes, public target stream, original CNF/XOR/field equations, and original curve group.
- [ ] Collect enough checked rows to measure useful rank and solve full-width column logs; record failed attempts and charged setup cost.
- [ ] Complete and verify a previously unseen public target with all five online phases and run a same-target rho reference under matching resource envelopes.
- [ ] Apply the frozen finite-grid coverage and unsupported-combination dispositions, and compare total cost with uncertainty before filling `selected_best_total_runtime`.

These checks are jointly needed to select a factor base on the requested
criterion. A verified partial relation would resolve only the first gate.

## Next discriminating step

- **Action or proof obligation:** Run the [first-pattern external XOR protocol](../research/koblitz_n83_factor_base_sweep_20261008/verification/external-xor-20261025/PROTOCOL.md) on both retained pools and both 5+1/4+2 shapes, with identical backend settings, independent process budgets, and complete model replay when SAT.
- **Inputs and controls:** Exact S3 compressed-object hashes and pilot manifest, trial-zero public corpus, known-answer group-lift tests, and matched Gray/hash process limits.
- **Execution limits and stop condition:** Record finite time, conflict, and memory caps per arm; preserve `INDETERMINATE`, timeout, or OOM without converting them to UNSAT.
- **Outcomes and next actions:** Verified partials advance to graph/rank measurement. A SAT model rejected by the group check calls for model blocking and a different pattern. Two censored arms call for a backend/encoding bottleneck study. Infrastructure failures require a fresh replay before interpretation.
- **Recheck trigger:** A checked natural partial, a changed solver backend or encoding, or a completed matched panel.

## Resolution and history

Unresolved. The 2026-10-25 XOR bridge and local pilot are a solver-backend
probe. Merging this record does not complete the selection criterion.
